*docReady.js*

This file provides a class called docReady or dR to allow/simplify binding events to the documentready event in all browsers.

Much of the code is inspired or directly from mootools.  This library does not require any other libraries.

*Usage:*
<code>
dR.add(function(){//do something on documentready});
</code>
